# GATE Abuse Application
A GATE application for detecting abuse in social media posts.

Note that this application has been developed in a number of stages and the initial version
dates back to at least 2015. Funding has come from numerous sources including, but not limited
to, Nesta, SoBigData, EDMO Ireland, and the FCDO.

This version is based upon the Political Abuse Monitor which is available through GATE Cloud:
https://cloud.gate.ac.uk/shopfront/displayItem/political-abuse-monitor -- if you want to experiment
with the application we strongly recommend you use the hosted service rather than attempting
to run the application locally; it is unlikely we will be able to provide support
