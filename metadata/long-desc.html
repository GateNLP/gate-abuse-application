<p>A service that tags abusive utterances in any text. It includes a feature, "type", indicating the type of abuse if any, such as sexist, racist etc, and a "target" feature that indicates if the abuse was aimed at the addressee or some other party. This can be run on any English language text.</p>

<p>It will also tag UK members of parliament for the 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections, and candidates for the 2017 and 2019 elections. Where an individual has run for election or been elected multiple times, multiple "Politician" annotations will appear with different "minorType" features. In this way, a person's recent political career can be tracked. The current parliament is the 58th parliament, with previous parliaments counting down, so that MPs with a minorType feature of "mp55" are those that were MPs before the general election in 2015.</p>

<p>The service will also tag a range of politically relevant topics, as well as entities such as persons, locations and organizations and Twitter entities such as hashtags and user mentions. It is designed to run on tweets in the original Twitter JSON input format, on which it will also produce metadata such as whether the tweet is a reply or a retweet. Upload your own or harvest some with our <a href="https://cloud.gate.ac.uk/shopfront/displayItem/twitter-collector">Twitter Collector</a>. However it can be run on any text.</p>

<p>Note that this is an updated and more generic version of our original GATE Hate for Politics app and should be used in preference to that service, unless you are wanting to replicate previous published work, as improvements will only be included in this version going forward.</p>
